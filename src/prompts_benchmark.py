# Benchmark Mode Workflow & Prompt Usage

Here's the complete benchmark mode workflow and how each prompt is being used:

## Overall Workflow

1. **Input**: System receives a question in benchmark mode
2. **Multi-Agent Network**: Executes search strategy based on question decomposition
3. **Generate Answer**: Creates structured answer from search results
4. **Reflect on Answer**: Evaluates answer quality and determines next steps
5. **Decision Point**: Either continue research or finalize answer
6. **Finalize Answer**: Synthesizes all findings into definitive answer
7. **End**: Returns final benchmark result

## Prompt Usage in Each Step

One year ago: {one_year_ago}
</TIME_CONTEXT>

You are a critical evaluator of research answers. Your job is to assess the quality of an answer and determine if further research is needed.

ORIGINAL QUESTION: {research_topic}

CURRENT ANSWER:
{current_answer}

SEARCH RESULTS USED:
{web_research_results}

RESEARCH ITERATIONS COMPLETED: {research_loop_count}
MAXIMUM ALLOWED ITERATIONS: {max_loops}

MANDATORY FIRST CHECK - EVIDENCE VALIDATION:
Before evaluating the content of the answer, you MUST verify:
1. Does the "SEARCH RESULTS USED" section contain actual search results?
2. If it states "No research results available yet" or similar, then ANY claims in the answer are unsupported
3. An answer claiming HIGH confidence without actual search results is automatically invalid
4. You cannot evaluate temporal claims or factual accuracy without actual evidence

CITATION QUALITY CHECK:
Additionally, evaluate the citation quality of the current answer:
1. Are factual claims properly supported with numbered citations [1][2]?
2. Do the citation numbers correspond to actual sources in the search results?
3. Are there unsupported claims lacking proper attribution?
4. Is the citation format consistent and properly placed?
5. Note: Poor citation quality should reduce confidence in the answer even if content seems accurate

Your task is to:
1. Evaluate whether the answer directly addresses the original question
2. Assess the confidence and evidence supporting the answer
3. Identify any gaps or missing information
4. Determine if further research is justified, considering:
   - Answer quality and completeness
   - Research efficiency and diminishing returns
   - Resource constraints (iterations completed vs. maximum)
5. If more research is needed, suggest a specific follow-up query

CRITICAL: When evaluating temporal claims (dates, current events, "current" positions):
- FIRST verify that actual search results exist to support any claims
- Use the TIME_CONTEXT above to verify if dates make sense
- Claims about events in the future relative to the current date are likely incorrect
- Claims about "current" positions should be verified against the current date
- Be especially skeptical of claims that contradict well-established recent facts
- WITHOUT actual search results, you CANNOT validate any temporal or factual claims

ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK:
1. Answer Quality:
   - Does the answer directly address what was asked? [Yes/Partially/No]
   - Is the confidence level appropriate given the evidence? [Yes/No]
   - Are there logical flaws or unsupported claims? [Yes/No]

2. Evidence Evaluation:
   - Are the sources reliable and relevant? [Yes/Partially/No]
   - Is critical information missing from the sources? [Yes/No]

3. Research Efficiency:
   - Has each iteration provided new relevant information? [Yes/No]
   - Is there a clear path for additional searches? [Yes/No]
   - Are we seeing diminishing returns from searches? [Yes/No]

4. Final Decision:
   - Should research continue? [Yes/No]

Current year: {current_year}
One year ago: {one_year_ago}
</TIME_CONTEXT>

You are tasked with verifying the accuracy of a final research answer against the expected answer in a benchmark evaluation.

QUESTION: {research_topic}
EXPECTED ANSWER: {expected_answer}
GENERATED ANSWER: {generated_answer}

Your verification must assess both content accuracy AND citation quality:

CONTENT VERIFICATION:
First, analyze the expected answer:
1. What type of information is it? (date, name, number, fact, explanation, etc.)
2. How specific is it? (exact value, range, multiple components, etc.)
3. What would constitute a correct match? (exact match, partially correct, etc.)

Then, compare the generated answer to the expected answer:
1. Is the generated answer correct? (Fully Correct, Partially Correct, Incorrect)
2. If partially correct, what parts are correct and what parts are missing or wrong?

CITATION VERIFICATION:
Evaluate the citation quality of the generated answer:
1. Are all factual claims properly cited with numbered citations [1][2]?
2. Do citation numbers correspond to actual sources?
3. Is there a proper References section with numbered sources?
4. Are citations placed appropriately after relevant statements?
5. Are there any unsupported claims lacking citations?

SCORING CRITERIA:
Assign a score from 0-100 considering BOTH content accuracy and citation quality:
   - 100: Perfect content match + excellent citations with complete References section
   - 90-99: Correct content + good citations with minor formatting issues
   - 80-89: Correct content + adequate citations but missing some attributions
   - 70-79: Mostly correct content + basic citations but incomplete References section
   - 60-69: Partially correct content + some citations but significant gaps in attribution
   - 50-59: Partially correct content + poor or missing citations
   - 25-49: Some correct elements + minimal or incorrect citations
   - 1-24: Mostly incorrect content regardless of citation quality
   - 0: Completely incorrect content or completely missing citations

CRITICAL: When evaluating temporal claims (dates, current events, "current" positions):
- Use the TIME_CONTEXT above to verify if dates make sense in both answers
- Flag any claims about events in the future relative to the current date as likely incorrect
- Consider whether "current" information is appropriate for the current date
- Account for the fact that expected answers may be outdated if they contain temporal references

QUESTION: {question}

RETRIEVED CONTEXT:
{retrieved_context}

Based on the RETRIEVED CONTEXT, analyze its sufficiency to answer the QUESTION.

IMPORTANT: When evaluating temporal claims or "current" information, use the CURRENT TIME CONTEXT above. Be especially careful about claims regarding who is "currently" in office, recent events, or future dates that may not have occurred yet.

Your output MUST be a JSON object with the following fields:
- "status": "COMPLETE" if the context is sufficient, "INCOMPLETE" otherwise.
- "useful_information": "A concise summary of the key pieces of information from the NEWLY FETCHED CONTENT part of the RETRIEVED CONTEXT that are directly relevant to answering the QUESTION. If no new useful information is found in the new content, provide an empty string."
- "missing_information": "If status is INCOMPLETE, describe what specific information is still missing from the RETRIEVED CONTEXT to fully answer the QUESTION. Consider both the previously accumulated knowledge and the newly fetched content. If status is COMPLETE, provide an empty string."

- One year ago: {one_year_ago}

Analyze the following information:

{retrieved_context}

Based on all the information provided above (especially the "CUMULATIVE KNOWLEDGE SO FAR" and "CURRENTLY MISSING INFORMATION"), generate a refined search query that will help gather the *specific* missing pieces of information needed to fully answer the "Original Research Topic/Question".

IMPORTANT: When refining queries about "current" information or recent events, use the CURRENT TIME CONTEXT above. Avoid generating queries that assume future events have occurred or that request information beyond the current date.

Your refined query should be targeted and concise. If specific entities (like names, organizations, dates) have been identified as useful, incorporate them into the refined query.

Your output MUST be a JSON object with the following fields:
